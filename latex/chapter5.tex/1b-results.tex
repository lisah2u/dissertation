As before, because the IV is categorical (binary), a non-parametric statistics is required. Using a Pearson's chi-square test with a Yates' continuity correction, subjects in the feedback condition showed significantly less implicature than in the control condition,  $\chi^2$ (1,N=200)=12.39, p$<$.001. The odds of implicature are 6.6 times more likely when there is no feedback given.
