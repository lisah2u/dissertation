\caption{Experiment Design} \\
1A & 2x2x2 between group posttest-only design where the control group is
presented with a set of textual expressions and asked to answer
questions about their meaning. Treatment groups are presented with either textual expressions or a dialog box expressing the same set of choices and asked the same
questions. Independent Variables: Modality, Deontic force, Attitude
toward privacy. Dependent Variable: Pragmatic implicature\tabularnewline
\hline 
1B & Between group posttest-only design where two groups are presented
with a cookie banner and later asked about whether or not they believe
the website placed \textquotedbl{}cookies\textquotedbl{} in their
browser. The treatment group is presented with feedback about the
consequence of their action / non-action following presentation of
the banner. Independent Variable: Feedback. Dependent Variable: Pragmatic
implicature.\tabularnewline
\hline 
2A & Between group posttest-only design where five groups are presented
an advertisement in the context of a webpage and asked to identify
hyperlinks. Treatment groups are presented an advertisement with embedded
image icons at four levels (known icon + different company, unknown icon, known call-to-action (CTA), ``DAA opt-out icon'') while the control group is presented with an embedded image from the same company as the advertiser. Independent
Variable: Icon type. Dependent Variable: Indexicality of icon. \tabularnewline
\hline 
2B & Between groups posttest-only design where three groups are presented
an advertisement in the context of a webpage and asked to identify
hyperlinks. Treatment groups are presented an advertisement at two
levels (iconic CTA, textual CTA) while the control group is presented
with an advertisement with no CTA. Independent Variable: Modality
of CTA. Dependent Variable: Click target.\tabularnewline
\hline 
3 & Between group repeated measures posttest-only design where a control
group is asked to respond to a survey containing questions relating
to activities (using questions drawn from \cite*{Acquisti:2012tp}; embarrassing, socially / ethically questionable, illegal). Participants
are notified in a privacy statement that there may be ad trackers
on the site. The treatment group receives exactly the same notification
and survey. However, tracker presence is indicated in a visual display
throughout the participant's session. Independent Variable: Visual
presence. Dependent Variable: Propensity to respond in the affirmative
to engaging in specific behaviors.\tabularnewline
