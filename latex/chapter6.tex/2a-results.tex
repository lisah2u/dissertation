Because cell counts were quite low, I used a Fisher's Exact test for significance on all tests. For hypothesis 2A1, comparing the McDonald's icon and Apple icon, the p value = 1 and there is no difference. 

For hypothesis 2A2, comparing the Apple icon versus the unknown icon, the p value =1 and there is no difference.

For hypothesis 2A3, comparing the AdChoice icon and FaceBook icon, participants show the AdChoices icon showed significantly less recognition of indexicality than in the control condition, p<.05. Odds ratio: 0.18. A Pearson's Chi-squared test with a Yates' continuity correction was little different: $\chi^2$ (1,N=110)=4.28, p<.05. The likelihood of clicking a FaceBook Ad over clicking a AdChoices icon in this study was 5.5.
