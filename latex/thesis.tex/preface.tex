\chapter*{Preface} 

This dissertation sits at the nexus of linguistics, psychology, and interaction design. Ostensibly, the topic centers on user confusion as it relates to certain practices in online behavioral adversing. While linguists have studied press, television, and radio advertising, behavioral and interactive advertising stand on new ground yet unexplored. Advertisers are no longer restricted from a broadcast-style communication with consumers in ads, but are silently watching behavior and driving interactions in close to real time. From this perspective, advertisers are influencing thought through an interactive medium. If this is true, there is more to Internet language than David Crystal surmises in his 2006 book on the topic. And interaction designers should become as attuned to the effects a user interface may have on comprehension as they are to other sorts of cognitive effects.
